Hi, I'm Wasim. I create tools that make programming more accessible. I'm currently working on [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/), a next-generation data science IDE. Previously, I was a core developer of [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), a notebook-driven software development tool suite.

Before that, I held technical leadership roles at South African startups. At [DataProphet](https://dataprophet.com/), I led the development of machine learning techniques for reducing defects in manufacturing plants. And at [Aerobotics](https://www.aerobotics.com/), I led the team that built aerial drone computer vision systems to provide farmers with high-resolution crop data.

I was once a professional [DotA 2](https://www.dota2.com/home) player and part of a team at [Bravado Gaming](https://www.bravadogaming.com/) that represented South Africa on the international stage.

This is where I share technical blogs and talks on software engineering and machine learning.

You can reach me via [email](mailto:mwlorgat@gmail.com){data-analytics="\"Consulting: Click\""} if you'd like to get in touch.
