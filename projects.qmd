My projects span machine learning, programming languages, personal analytics, browser extensions, code editors, and personal tools to support my workflows.
I work on projects for fun, to learn, or to solve a specific problem I have.
More recent projects are listed first.

### [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/)

I'm currently working on [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/), a next-generation data science IDE by [Posit](https://posit.co/).

### [Jim](https://github.com/seeM/Jim)

Jim (Jupyter in macOS) is a simple, beautiful Jupyter notebook editor for macOS. Think [Bear](https://bear.app/), for [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

### [Meepo](https://meepo.shop)

A smarter search engine for a local (South African) fashion and homeware store.

{{< video ./posts/videos/meepo-demo-3.mp4 >}}

I have no affiliation with said store. I built this for myself, because I was frustrated at how difficult it was to find what I wanted with the existing search engine + I was curious how well CLIP (a relatively new AI technique with open source code and models) would work here.

I think it works quite well. It's much more forgiving than the original search engine. I don't have to guess what exactly they decided to label a particular item. But what I like even more is that it works quite well for abstract things like "colourful shoes".

Here's the full stack:

- Hardware: Deployed on a 2CPU 4GB RAM VPS with docker
- Storage: SQLite + object storage (for images)
- Search: CLIP text/image neural networks + faiss similarity search index
- Pipeline: Python scripts + cron
- Web: Django serving HTML/Tailwind/daisyUI
- IDE: Developed in notebooks with nbdev

I tried to keep the implementation as simple as possible and I'm happy with the result. It took ~2 weeks to build and has been running seamlessly without my input ever since.

### [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai)

I'm a core developer of nbdev, an open source notebook-driven software development platform.

nbdev let's me use exploratory programming (related to REPL-driven development and literate programming) for all of my software development.

I also came up with the idea of hooking into the Jupyter file save API and using a custom git merge driver to improve Jupyter/git integration. All of the core functionality used by these hooks was already implemented by other nbdev core developers. You can find out more in [the write-up](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2022-08-25-jupyter-git.html).

### [Plum dispatch for fastcore (experimental)](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/pull/415)

An experimental PR to [fastcore](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore) (the core library powering the [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) deep learning framework), that replaces its custom type dispatch system with [plum-dispatch](https://github.com/wesselb/plum).
Both bring [Julia's multiple dispatch](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/) into Python using type annotations and decorators.

## 2021

### EasyEquities browser extension

A browser extension for the EasyEquities investment platform built with TypeScript, React, React Router, and Mock Service Worker (to develop against a mocked version of their API).

This started with frustration that EasyEquities didn't provide a single view of my holdings across all of my investment accounts, nor of my time-weighted returns.
I made good progress but stopped building this since there's no public EasyEquities API, and sending handcrafted requests to the internal API of my investment platform seems like a bad idea.

### [Repo links](https://github.com/seeM/repo-links)

A tiny command-line tool to quickly open URLs related to your repos. I made this for a smoother experience while working on a manyrepo codebase.

### [MyFitnessPal to SQLite](https://github.com/seeM/myfitnesspal-to-sqlite)

Save your personal data from MyFitnessPal to a SQLite database.
I occasionally use MyFitnessPal to track my weight and calories.
Inspired by the [dogsheep movement](https://dogsheep.github.io/), I built this for personal analytics on my own data.

### [CircleCI to SQLite](https://github.com/seeM/circleci-to-sqlite)

Save your personal data from CircleCI to a SQLite database.
I threw this together for a quick analysis on build times at a former workplace, which we could then follow up with easy build pipeline optimisations.

### Reverse engineering ncode

An attempt at reverse engineering ncode paper technology.
I got all the way down from what looked like dots on paper to a matrix which I needed to decode.

### [Romulus](https://github.com/seeM/romulus)

An experimental framework for creating structure-aware editors.
The idea was that actions (e.g. move left, insert character) would be aware of the context surrounding the cursor location within the (tree-)structured document, thus would have slightly more intelligent behaviour.

For example, given a document `((foo)|`, where `|` represents the cursor, and where `((foo))` is a known symbol represented some `BlockRef` object, inserting `)` would know to create a `BlockRef` object in the internal tree structure.
Like a hackier version of tree sitter.
The vision was to use this framework to create a [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) clone using an enhanced markdown-like syntax for personal use.

### [Zip](https://github.com/seeM/zip)

Functional hierarchical zipper (tree cursor), with navigation, editing, and enumeration.
A port of `clojure.zip` to JavaScript that I intended to use in Romulus.

### [Roam tools](https://github.com/seeM/roam-tools)

Tiny command-line tools for working with Roam graphs.

### [Roam parser](https://github.com/seeM/roam-parser)

A tiny Roam parser built with Clojure and instaparse.

### [Image alignment](https://github.com/seeM/image-align)

Keypoint-based alignment of two grayscale images using [ORB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_FAST_and_rotated_BRIEF) and [RANSAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample_consensus) via [skimage](https://scikit-image.org/).
This was completed as a take-home assignment for a job application, so I limited the implementation to a max of 8 hours.

## 2020

### [Editor](https://github.com/seeM/editor)

Minimal terminal text editor written in Python and curses.
I wrote a corresponding [step-by-step tutorial](https://wasimlorgat.com/posts/editor/) as well.

### [Advent of Code](https://github.com/seeM/advent-of-code-2020)

I enjoyed taking part in AoC for a few years ([2017](https://github.com/seeM/advent-of-code-2017), [2018](https://github.com/seeM/advent-of-code-2018), [2019](https://github.com/seeM/advent-of-code-2019), and [2020](https://github.com/seeM/advent-of-code-2020)).

### [Alfred Github local](https://github.com/seeM/alfred-github-local)

An Alfred workflow to open GitHub repo URLs via a local workspace directory. No GitHub API access needed.

### [pdlog](https://github.com/DataProphet/pdlog)

Seamless logging for [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframe operations, inspired by [tidylog](https://github.com/elbersb/tidylog).
We used pandas in production extensively at a former workplace, and our code often ended up overwhelmed with logging logic.
With pdlog it's simple: instead of calling, say, `df.dropna()`, call `df.log.dropna()` and it'll log `<pdlog> dropna: dropped 1 row (17%), 5 rows remaining`.

## 2018

### [Neural networks from scratch](https://github.com/seeM/nnet)

A basic implementation of neural networks from scratch.
Shortly after my encounter with reinforcement learning, I realised that deep learning was an important precursor and shifted my studies there.

### [Reinforcement learning from scratch](https://github.com/seeM/reinforcement-learning)

Re-implementing sections of Sutton and Barto's [*Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf).
My first inspiration in AI was the possibility that a computer could play games better than the best humans.
I was determined to build one of these AIs myself.
